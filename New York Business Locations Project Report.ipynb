We will first look at the most popular types of businesses in New York based on check-in data, then using that data, we will determine which neighbourhoods are lacking those businesses to deduce the potential business opportunities. This type of data analysis has been chosen to be conducted because it targets to aid those who wish to open a business, but may not know which areas are suitable for business or which type of businesses are needed."
